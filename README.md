# GraphCube

## 🚀 Demo
Check out the live version of the project [here](https://rubikgraph.dev-dorian-laguna.com/)

This project is an interactive simulation of a 3D Rubik's Cube using Three.js and Vue.js. It allows users to manipulate the cube and see the movements reflected in a graph, visualizing each twist and move in real time.


## ⚙️ Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository:
    $ git clone https://github.com/DorianLaguna/GraphCube.git

    cd cubo-rubik

### 3. Install dependencies:
    npm install
    
### 4. Run the project:
    npm run serve

## 🕹️ How to Use
- __Rotate the Cube:__ Click and drag the cube with your mouse to rotate it in any direction.
- __Make Moves:__ Click and drag points to simulate specific cube movements.
- __Track Movements:__ The cube is updated at each move reflecting the movement of the graphs, providing a clear visualization of the cube's current state.

## 🔧 Future Improvements
### Some features currently under consideration for future development include:
- Saving and Loading Cube States: Allow users to save their progress.
